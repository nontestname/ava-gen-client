# AVA-Gen: An Automated Voice Assistant Generation Framework from GUI Test Cases Reusing

AVA-Gen is an automated tool including two parts:

1. A pipeline that converts existing Espresso UI tests (Java/Kotlin) into VA methods and using LLM calls (GPT APIs) to generate other code description artifacts.
2. A runtime server and client architecture that support converting user request to the VA tasks.

This repo shows the AVA-Gen Android Client.
