# AppVA: From GUI Tests to Conversational Interaction: A New Perspective on App-Specific Voice Assistants

AppVA is an automated early prototype including two parts:

1. A pipeline that converts existing Espresso UI tests (Java/Kotlin) into Voice Assistant artifacts.
2. A runtime server and client architecture that support lively VA functionalities from user request to the VA tasks executions.

This repo shows the AppVA Android Client.
